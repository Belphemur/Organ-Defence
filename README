******************************
* 1. How to compile the game *
******************************

The source code is provided with a Makefile, so it's kinda easy to compile it and make it run

1.1 Server
----------

- Open a terminal and go to the source code directory.
- Type "make server" and press Enter
- That's it :)

1.2 Clients
-----------

- Open a terminal and go to the source code directory
- Type "make client" and press Enter
- That's it :)

1.3 Be tidy
-----------

In order to remove all the temporary .o files, you may use the "make clean" command.
If you want to completely remove the game (executables and object files -- not the source code), you may
want to use the "make cleana" command.


****************************
* 2. How to start the Game *
****************************

2.1 Server
----------

- Go to the the source code directory and compile the server (see above)
- Run the "server" executable, and as an argument, give the number of clients you except. E.g., for a 4-player game, type in a terminal "./server -n 4"
- At the time being, the server outputs some informations about the current state of the game. You also may want to read the
  logs to see what's happening (see below)
  
2.2 Clients
-----------

- Go to the source code directory and compile the client (see above)
- Open a terminal and run the "client" executable. You need to give the server name (hostname) as a parameter of the client exec.
  For instance, if the server is running on di-pc21, just type "./client di-pc21".
- Enjoy your gaming

(Note: Obviously, the server has to be running when the clients are connecting)


***************************
* 3. How to run the tests *
***************************

3.1 Compiling the test version
-------------------------------

- Open a terminal and go to the sources' root directory
- Type "make tests" and press Enter

3.2 Running the tests
---------------------

- When running "make tests", the tests run just after the compilation.

3.3 What happened ? Server and client logs
------------------------------------------

When running the actual game (not the test version), both server and client outputs some log. You may find them in the root dir of the game.
The server log is named serverlog.txt. It states the action of all the process running on the server (both client communicators and game engine).
The client log is obviously name clientlog.txt. It states everything the client is doing.
